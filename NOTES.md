`arduino/` 

contains the sketches to receive and execute commands on the arm. 

`arduino/control_braccio/` 

uses the basic, buggy, braccio lib

`arduino/control_custom/` 

is my attempt at controlling the servos directly. It is even more basic than the braccio lib, lacks speed control, but allows a custom pose at start.

`GUI/` contains a small GUI that allows manual control of the arm.

`Video/` contains footage for future vlog endeavors
